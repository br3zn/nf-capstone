# "[Bubatz](https://bubatz.breznsoiza.com/)" - educational app about cannabis
> This is my capstone project for a web developer bootcamp hosted by :fish: [neueFische](https://www.neuefische.de/)

This project is for cannabis users who wants to get the most fitting strain recommendations, depending on the desired effect. You'll also find data about the terpenes, their effects and use-case and how the different consumption methods affect you.
Since the legalisation of cannabis in germany is coming fast, I want to help cannabis users on their journey with important information to find the best solution for them.

_This is not about the best looking or most exotic sounding strains, but the benefits of using cannabis for different issues. There are enough portals covering this._
